        <p class="body">While I currently don't have any prices or terms for web design or similar coding/design projects, I'm open to discuss if you're interested in what I do and would like me on board for one of your projects!</p>

        Read my Terms of Service. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Send me an email, twitter, or instagram DM with this order form: <br>
            <code  style="line-height: normal; display: block;">
            What kind of art you want: <br>
            What do you want drawn: <br>

            Payment type: (Upfront | When starting | Split) <br>
            Paypal email: <br>
            Did you read and agree to my terms of service? <br>

        <li>
        After confirming details, I will send you a Paypal invoice and add you to my commission queue. You may pay it now, or pay it when I'm ready to begin work. <br>
            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> My commission queue is a priority queue and first paid first served. Rush orders are highest priority, and below that, upfront USD > unpaid USD > non USD. That means, lower priority comms <i> will</i> get shifted back in favor of higher priority work. Only upfront USD orders will guarantee their spot in the queue. 
        </li>
        <li>
       WIPs will be sent as I work– typically at pose sketch, final sketch, and flat colors stages. Edits can be asked for only at that current stage: I will not make sketch edits after colors have been done and I will not make color edits after I begin shading.
        </li>
        <li>
      You will be asked to confirm the final sketch before I start colors; I will not continue working without confirmation. Failure to confirm within 14 days will result in the commission being dropped. If you asked for split payment, you will get a second paypal invoice at this point– failure to pay within 14 days will result in the commission being dropped as well.
        </li>
        <li>
      Your final piece will be delivered by email to the paypal email you paid with. If the piece has additional requirements, such as printing or merch, I will continue to work with the production company and ship it to the address listed on your Paypal. If you need a different address, please request that through email only. 
        </li>
    </ol>

        Please note commissions tend to take longer than artwork I do for myself! I typically finish roughly 2-3 commissions per month. USD commissions and personal gifts typically take priority over virtual currency commissions.
