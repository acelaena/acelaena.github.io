<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew, where do I start talking about this? The Shrouded Kingdom is a comic/story/game that I've been working on and off in various formats since 2013. Mostly because I can't decide on one singular format to stick to. Originally, it was intended to be a Fire Emblem/Pokemon crossover, akin to Pokemon Warriors, but I've been considering revamping the entire thing to (possibly) an original novel or webcomic.

Despite his hardened exterior and unsavory occupation, he cares deeply for the state of kingdom, especially for the little people less fortunate than him. Highly chaotic. His natural hair color is brown, but due to certain events it has been permanently altered to a shimmery blue.

As the eldest of three siblings, he's far more mature than his years and often the voice of reason for his friends. True lawful. Regardless of whatever is thrown in his way, there's a stalwart loyalty in him that never goes away.

Unbefitting of her position, she loves to play pranks on people.
