<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew, where do I start talking about this? The Shrouded Kingdom is a comic/story/game that I've been working on and off in various formats since 2013. Mostly because I can't decide on one singular format to stick to. Originally, it was intended to be a Fire Emblem/Pokemon crossover, akin to Pokemon Warriors, but I've been considering revamping the entire thing to (possibly) an original novel or webcomic.

        Age: Unknown | Gender: Fluid | Height: 5'11" | Blood type: A <br>

        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A genderfluid former assassin also known as Nightshade. Despite his hardened exterior and unsavory occupation, he cares deeply for the state of kingdom, especially for the little people less fortunate than him. Usually presents male but can be occasionally seen in a more feminine look.

        <p>
        Age: 22 | Gender: Male | Height: 6'1" | Blood type: AB <br>

        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lancer from a clan known for its warriors. A pacifist at heart, and far, far too trusting for his own good. As the eldest of three siblings, one extremely timid and the other an obnoxious little shithole, he's far more mature than his years and is often the voice of reason among his friends.
